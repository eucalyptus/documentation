		<p>The
			administration CLI is installed when you install Eucalyptus
			server-side components. The administration CLI is for maintaining
			and modifying Eucalyptus.</p>
		<p>The other user CLI, called Euca2ools, can be downloaded and installed
			on clients. Euca2ools is a set of commands for end users and can be used with both
			Eucalyptus and Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
		<p>The commands used in this guide assume that the environment variables
			exported by a eucarc file for an administrative Eucalyptus user have
			been set. For more information, see the <xref
				href="../install-guide/index.dita">Eucalyptus Installation
				Guide</xref>.</p>
		
		<note type="important">If you haven't already done so, change the
			default password for the administration user. You can do this using
			the <apiname>euare-usermodloginprofile</apiname>.</note>
