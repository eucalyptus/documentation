		<p>Make sure that each host you installed a Eucalyptus component on resolves to an IP
			address. Edit the <filepath>/etc/hosts</filepath> file if necessary.</p>
		<note importance="required">Eucalyptus 3.3 requires version 7 of the Java Virtual Machine.
			Make sure that your CLOUD_OPTS settings in the /etc/eucalyptus/eucalyptus.conf file
			either do not set <codeph>--java-home</codeph>, or that <codeph>--java-home</codeph>
			points to a version 7 JVM. This needs to happen before services are started but after
			the upgraded packages are installed.</note>
		<p>Start the Eucalyptus components in the order presented in this guide.</p>
