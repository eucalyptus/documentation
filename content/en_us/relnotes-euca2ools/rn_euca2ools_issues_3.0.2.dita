        href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/TOOLS-385">TOOLS-385</xref>)</entry>
      <entry>Occurs when the locale settings prevent python from encoding all of the
       characters in a command's output. One can work around this bug by explicitly setting the
       <codeph>LC_CTYPE</codeph> environment variable to a locale that is capable of handling the characters in use,
       such as <codeph>en_US.UTF-8</codeph>. </entry>
