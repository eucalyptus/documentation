		<p>Eucalyptus recommends restricting physical and network access to all
			hosts comprising the Eucalyptus cloud, and disabling unused
			applications and ports on all machines used in your cloud.</p>
		<p> After installation, no local access to Eucalyptus component hosts is
			required for normal cloud operations and all normal cloud operations
			can be done over remote web service APIs.</p>
		<p>The CLC and Walrus are the only two components that generally expect
			remote connections from end users. Each Eucalyptus component can be
			put behind a firewall following the list of open ports and
			connectivity requirements described in the <xref
				href="../ig/configuring_iptables.dita">Configure the
				Firewall</xref> section.</p>

			Note that Eucalyptus does not currently support SELinux
			configurations, and we recommend disabling SELinux.</p>
