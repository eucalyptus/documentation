	<conbody>
		<p>Eucalyptus 3.2.2 is a maintenance release and has no new features.
			However, we would like to point out two changes in 3.2.x that have
			not been explicitly noted before:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>DRBD needs an explicit mount point in
					<filepath>/etc/fstab</filepath> on each Walrus in your
				cloud. This is covered in the Installation Guide's section,
					<xref
					href="http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/latest/ig/config_drbd.html"
					scope="external" format="html"
				>ig/config_drbd.htm</xref>.</li>
			<li>Images uploaded to Walrus are private by default. To make images
				public, enter the following:
				<codeblock>euca-modify-image-attribute -l -a all [emi-identifier]</codeblock>
			</li>
			<li>The
				<codeph>[partition].storage.lunmigrationtimeout</codeph>
				property for EMC VNX SANs now uses hours instead of seconds. The
				default value is 12 hours.</li>

		</ul>
