	<title>Providing Navigation, Links, and References</title>
	<shortdesc>We can help readers navigate more quickly and reduce translation costs if we use consistent methods and phrases to introduce referents and links. Navigation eases readers’ experience with documentation. It enables them to see what information is available, understand how it might be inter-related, and sometimes to move quickly from point to point within and across information resources.</shortdesc>
